/*Case Study 2 (Investigating metric spike)
The structure of the table with the definition of each column that you must work on is present in the project image*/

/*Table-1: users
This table includes one row per user, with descriptive information about that userâ€™s account.*/

/*Table-2: events
This table includes one row per event, where an event is an action that a user has taken. These events include login events, messaging events, search events, events logged as users progress through a signup funnel, events around received emails.*/

/*Table-3: email_events
This table contains events specific to the sending of emails. It is similar in structure to the events table above.*/
